Below are **production-grade DAX measures** aligned directly with your **US Healthcare Analysis Power BI model**. These measures assume a **star schema** with a central **Fact_Visits** table and standard dimension tables (Patients, Hospitals, Providers, Payers, Date).

The measures are written to be **efficient, reusable, and executive-ready**.

---

## 1. Core Volume & Financial Measures

### Total Visits

```DAX
Total Visits =
COUNT ( Fact_Visits[visit_id] )
```

### Total Charges

```DAX
Total Charges =
SUM ( Fact_Visits[total_charge_amount] )
```

### Insurance Payments

```DAX
Insurance Payments =
SUM ( Fact_Visits[insurance_payment_amount] )
```

### Patient Payments

```DAX
Patient Payments =
SUM ( Fact_Visits[patient_payment_amount] )
```

---

## 2. Accounts Receivable & Payment Ratios

### Accounts Receivable (AR)

```DAX
Accounts Receivable =
[Total Charges] - ( [Insurance Payments] + [Patient Payments] )
```

### Insurance Payment Ratio

```DAX
Insurance Payment Ratio (%) =
DIVIDE ( [Insurance Payments], [Total Charges], 0 )
```

### Patient Payment Ratio

```DAX
Patient Payment Ratio (%) =
DIVIDE ( [Patient Payments], [Total Charges], 0 )
```

---

## 3. Patient & Admission Analytics

### Total Patients

```DAX
Total Patients =
DISTINCTCOUNT ( Fact_Visits[patient_id] )
```

### Average Charge per Visit

```DAX
Avg Charge per Visit =
DIVIDE ( [Total Charges], [Total Visits], 0 )
```

### Average Length of Stay (Days)

```DAX
Avg Length of Stay =
AVERAGEX (
    Fact_Visits,
    DATEDIFF (
        Fact_Visits[admission_date],
        Fact_Visits[discharge_date],
        DAY
    )
)
```

---

## 4. Time Intelligence Measures

Assumes a properly marked **Date** table related to `Fact_Visits[admission_date]`.

### Total Charges YTD

```DAX
Total Charges YTD =
TOTALYTD (
    [Total Charges],
    'Date'[Date]
)
```

### Total Charges YoY Growth %

```DAX
Total Charges YoY % =
VAR PrevYearCharges =
    CALCULATE (
        [Total Charges],
        SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR ( 'Date'[Date] )
    )
RETURN
DIVIDE (
    [Total Charges] - PrevYearCharges,
    PrevYearCharges,
    0
)
```

### Admissions MoM Growth %

```DAX
Admissions MoM % =
VAR PrevMonthVisits =
    CALCULATE (
        [Total Visits],
        DATEADD ( 'Date'[Date], -1, MONTH )
    )
RETURN
DIVIDE (
    [Total Visits] - PrevMonthVisits,
    PrevMonthVisits,
    0
)
```

---

## 5. Hospital Performance Measures

### Visits per Hospital

```DAX
Visits per Hospital =
[Total Visits]
```

(Used with Hospital dimension in visuals)

### Hospital AR Rank

```DAX
Hospital AR Rank =
RANKX (
    ALL ( Hospitals[hospital_name] ),
    [Accounts Receivable],
    ,
    DESC,
    DENSE
)
```

---

## 6. Payer & Provider Performance

### Total Claims

```DAX
Total Claims =
[Total Visits]
```

### Avg Insurance Payment per Claim

```DAX
Avg Insurance Payment per Claim =
DIVIDE ( [Insurance Payments], [Total Claims], 0 )
```

### Payer Contribution %

```DAX
Payer Contribution % =
DIVIDE (
    [Insurance Payments],
    CALCULATE ( [Insurance Payments], ALL ( Payers ) ),
    0
)
```

---

## 7. Procedure & Utilization Analysis

### Procedure Volume

```DAX
Procedure Volume =
COUNT ( Fact_Visits[procedure_code] )
```

### Procedure Share %

```DAX
Procedure Share % =
DIVIDE (
    [Procedure Volume],
    CALCULATE ( [Procedure Volume], ALL ( Fact_Visits[procedure_code] ) ),
    0
)
```

---

## 8. Regional Impact Analysis

### Regional Patients

```DAX
Regional Patients =
DISTINCTCOUNT ( Fact_Visits[patient_id] )
```

### Regional Expense Share %

```DAX
Regional Expense Share % =
DIVIDE (
    [Total Charges],
    CALCULATE ( [Total Charges], ALL ( Hospitals[region] ) ),
    0
)
```

---

## 9. Pandemic-Specific Measures (Optional)

### Pandemic Visits

```DAX
Pandemic Visits =
CALCULATE (
    [Total Visits],
    Fact_Visits[admission_date] >= DATE ( 2020, 1, 1 ),
    Fact_Visits[admission_date] <= DATE ( 2022, 12, 31 )
)
```

### Pandemic Expense Impact

```DAX
Pandemic Expense Impact =
CALCULATE (
    [Total Charges],
    Fact_Visits[admission_date] >= DATE ( 2020, 1, 1 ),
    Fact_Visits[admission_date] <= DATE ( 2022, 12, 31 )
)
```

---

## 10. Executive KPI Measures

### Cost per Patient

```DAX
Cost per Patient =
DIVIDE ( [Total Charges], [Total Patients], 0 )
```

### Revenue Realization Rate

```DAX
Revenue Realization Rate % =
DIVIDE (
    [Insurance Payments] + [Patient Payments],
    [Total Charges],
    0
)
```
